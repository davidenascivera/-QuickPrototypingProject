# 3-DOF Robotic Arm with Augmented Reality Control

The original goal of this project was to develop a full robotic arm, but testing was conducted using 3 servomotors. The servomotors are controlled remotely through augmented reality (AR) using Unity 3D and Vuforia. This project, completed during my bachelor's degree, integrates several key technologies:

- **ESP8266**: Microcontroller programmed with Arduino for servo control.
- **Blynk 2.0**: IoT platform used for communication between the ESP8266 and Unity.
- **Unity 3D + Vuforia**: Enables AR-based control and real-time target recognition.

The project provides a foundation for learning mechanics, electronics, and IoT concepts, and it is flexible for future expansion and improvements.
